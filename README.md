What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with 

The challenging part of this assignment was learning a new synatx for html.
I found it much easier to learn, and thought why isnt this taught first in the align core to learn how to code?
Once I figured out how it all connects coding was as smooth as butter. I still dont know a lot of stuff but looking forward to learn.

ABout 1 week
I wasted a few days trying to figure out why it wasnt connecting and discovered that its very case sensitive and folder location sensitive.
